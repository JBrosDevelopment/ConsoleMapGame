# ConsoleMapGame
This code was written with visual Studio Code in C#. It creates a map of 0s, with 1 being the player, and 2 being walls. It is very simply setup so that it can be easily edited. 

The Console folder has an entire project for the console. The WindowsForm folder has the entire project written so a window will popup instead of a console.

The .exe files are in the bin\debug folders.
